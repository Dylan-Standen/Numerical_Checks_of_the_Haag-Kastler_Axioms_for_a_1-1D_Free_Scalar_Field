# Numerical_Checks_of_the_Haag-Kastler_Axioms_for_a_1-1D_Free_Scalar_Field

Here is my paper on a numerical check of the Haag–Kastler axioms of AQFT. It aims to give a brief overview of AQFT by introducing the Wightman and Haag–Kastler axioms, and checking the latter numerically using lattice field theory.
